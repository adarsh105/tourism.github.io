						<h1>About The Land of Gods</h1>
						<p>
							Uttarakhand, a state in northern India crossed by the Himalayas, is known for its Hindu pilgrimage sites. Rishikesh, a major centre for yoga study, was made famous by the Beatles’ 1968 visit. The city hosts the evening Ganga Aarti, a spiritual gathering on the sacred Ganges River. The state’s forested Jim Corbett National Park shelters Bengal tigers and other native wildlife.

							Rig Veda, the most ancient of the scriptures says, ‘there is no happiness for him who does not travel. The fortune of him who is sitting sits, it rises when he rises, it sleeps when he sleeps, it moves when he moves. 
						</p>

						<p>
							A major portion of human history has been created by travels – treatises and historical accounts are filled with stories of men who travelled to conquer, to convert, to trade, to plunder and most importantly to quench their curiosity. Every mountain and ocean stimulated human curiosity to see and know beyond the mundane. This unremitting beckoning upset their sleep and logic but invigorated their fancies. The obsession for the unknown was an indivisible element of those fancies and humans, as always, have been known to live and die for them.

							Now, in the changed circumstances of the 21st century people still travel mostly when they get tired of routine circumstances or to put it more starkly whenever they find spare time from their demanding and hectic routines. There could be scores of other motives as well. Whatever may the motivation be, it is a truth that every journey does detune and retune one’s intimate self. A whole lot ensues between embark and disembark. Some strings get tightened and some get loosened.

						<h1>Nainital</h1>
						<p>Nainital is a glittering jewel in the Himalyan necklace, blessed with scenic natural spledour and varied natural resources . Dotted with lakes , Nainital has earned the epithet of ‘ Lake District ‘ of India . The most prominent of the lakes is Naini lake ringed by hills . Nainital has a varied topography . Some of the important places in the district are Nainital , Haldwani , Kaladhungi , Ramnagar , Bhowali , Ramgarh , Mukteshwar , Bhimtal , Sattal and Naukuchiatal . Nainital’s unending expense of scenic beauty is nothing short of a romance with awe-inspiring and pristine Mother nature.

						Nainital is the headquarter of Nainital District and It is also the divisional Headquarter of Kumaon Division of Uttarakhand State.</p>
						<h3>Historical Background</h3>
						<p>Nainital is referred to in the ‘Manas Khand’ of the ‘Skanda Purana’ as the Tri-Rishi-Sarovar,the lake of the three sages, Atri, Pulastya and Pulaha who were reputed to have arrived here on a penitential pilgrimage, and, finding no water to quench their thirst dug a hole and siphoned water into it from Mansarovar the sacred lake in Tibet.

						The Second important mythological reference to Nainital is as one of 64 ‘Shakti Peeths’.These centres were created wherever parts of the charred body of Sati fell, when Lord Shiva was carrying around her corpse in grief, It is said that the left eye (Nain) of Sati fell here and this gave rise to patron deity of town Nainital. It is said that the lake is formed in the emerald eye shape. Naina Devi temple is located at the northern end of the lake, thus name of Nainital was derived from Naina and the tal (Lake).</p>

						<h1>Tehri</h1>
						<p>The district of Tehri Garhwal stretches from the snow clad Himalayan peaks of Thalaiya Sagar, Jonli and the Gangotri group all the way to the foothills near Rishikesh. The gushing Bhagirathi which runs through seems to divide the district into two, while the Bhilangna, Alaknanda, Ganga and Yamuna rivers border it on the east and west.Its neighbouring districts are Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Pauri, Rudraprayag and Dehradun.

						Lying on the southern slopes of outer Himalayas, Tehri Garhwal is on of the sacred hilly districts of Uttarakhand State. Before the creation of universe, Lord Brahma is said to have meditated on this sacred land. Muni-ki-Reti and Tapovan of the district are the places of penance for the ancient Rishis. Its hilly terrain and lack of easy communications have helped it to preserve its culture almost intact. Tehri and Garhwal are the two words combined for naming the district as Tehri Garhwal.</p>

						<h1>Haridwar</h1>
						<p>A paradise for nature-lovers, Haridwar presents a kaleidoscope of Indian culture and civilization. Haridwar, termed as ‘Gateway to Gods’ is also known as Mayapuri, Kapila, Gangadwar. The followers of Lord Shiva (Har) and followers of Lord Vishnu (Hari) pronounce this place Haridwar and Hardwar respectively as told by some. It is also a point of entry to Dev Bhoomi and Char Dham (Four main centers of pilgrimage in Uttarakhand Viz. Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri).

						The legendary King Bhagirath is said to have brought the river Ganga from heaven to the Earth in order to provide salvation to his ancestors. It is also said that Haridwar has been sanctified by the presence of three Gods; Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. History says that a foot print on the stone, that is set in the upper wall of Har-Ki-Pauri where the Holy Ganga touches it all the time. Devout believers feel that they can attain their salvation after a dip in the sacred Ganga at Haridwar.

						Haridwar is also one of the four places; where Kumbh Mela occurs after rotation of every twelve years and Ardh Kumbh after every six years. It is said that drops of Amrit (Elixir) fell in to the Brahmkund of Har-Ki-Pauri, therefore it is believed that a dip in the Brahmakund on this particular day, which is very auspicious and happens when Jupiter (Brihaspati) meets Aquarius (Kumbh). Kumbh, 1998 was the last Maha Kumbh of this century. Yet beyond the mystic aura and mythology, Haridwar casts another magic spell on the visitors. Being one of the oldest living cities, Haridwar finds its mention, in the ancient Hindu scriptures as it waves through the life and time, stretching from the period of the Buddha to the more recent British advent. Haridwar has not only remained the abode of the weary in body, mind and spirit, but also served as the centre of attraction for many, for learning arts science and culture. Haridwar has a long standing position as a great source for Ayurvedic medicines and herbal remedies as well as its unique Gurukul school system of traditional education, the scenic beauty and lush greenery…they all give the city unique flavors and charm; a must among the sojourn centers in a discoverer’s itinerary of Uttarakhand – A destination for all seasons.</p>

						<h1>Uttarkashi</h1>
						<p>Uttarkashi district was created on February 24, 1960 out of what then constituted the parganas of Rawain and Uttarkashi of Rawain tahsil of erstwhile Tehri Garhwal district. It sprawls in the extreme north-west corner of the state over an area of 8016 sq. kms. in the rugged terrain of the mystic Himalayas. On its north lie Himachal Pradesh State and the territory of Tibet and the district of Chamoli in the east. The district is named after its headquarters town Uttarkashi, an ancient place with rich cultural heritage and as the name suggests is the Kashi of north (Uttara) held almost as high a veneration as Kashi of the plain (Varanasi).

						Both the Kashi of the plain (Varanasi) as well as the Kashi of north are situated on the banks of the river Ganga (Bhagirathi). The area which is held sacred and known as Uttarkashi, lies between the rivers Syalam Gad also known as the Varuna and Kaligad also known as the Asi. The Varuna and the Asi are also the names of the rivers between which the Kashi of the plain lies. One of the holiest Ghats in Uttarkashi is Manikarnika so is the one by the same name in Varanasi. Both have temples dedicated to Vishwanath.</p>
